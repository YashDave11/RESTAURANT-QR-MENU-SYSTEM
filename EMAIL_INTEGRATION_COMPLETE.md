1. **Get Gmail App Password**

   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Create password for "Mail" → "Other"

2. **Update .env**

   ```env
   EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
   ```

3. **Restart server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option B: Skip Email Setup (Development)

Don't want to set up email right now? No problem!

- The system automatically logs reset codes to console
- Everything works perfectly for testing
- Set up email later when you're ready

## 📧 Email Template Preview

When users request a password reset, they receive:

```
Subject: Reset Your Password

Hi [User Name],

We received a request to reset your password.
Use the code below to reset your password:

┌─────────────────┐
│   847392        │  ← 6-digit code
└─────────────────┘

This code will expire in 1 hour.

If you didn't request a password reset,
you can safely ignore this email.
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Gmail (Recommended for Testing)

```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
APP_NAME=Restaurant QR Menu
```

### SendGrid (Production Ready)

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key
APP_NAME=Restaurant QR Menu
```

### Mailgun

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-mailgun-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-mailgun-password
APP_NAME=Restaurant QR Menu
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User requests reset** → Enters email on forgot-password page
2. **System generates code** → Random 6-digit code
3. **Code is hashed** → Stored securely in database
4. **Email is sent** → User receives code via email
5. **User enters code** → On reset-password page
6. **Code is verified** → Compared with hashed version
7. **Password updated** → User can login with new password

---

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ Tokens are hashed before storage (bcrypt)
✅ 1-hour expiration on reset codes
✅ Single-use tokens (deleted after use)
✅ Email + code verification required
✅ No email enumeration (same response for valid/invalid emails)
✅ Rate limiting on forgot-password endpoint

## 📊 Email Service Comparison

| Service  | Free Tier    | Best For   | Setup Time |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Gmail    | Unlimited\*  | Testing    | 2 min      |
| SendGrid | 100/day      | Production | 5 min      |
| Mailgun  | 5,000/month  | Production | 5 min      |
| AWS SES  | 62,000/month | Enterprise | 15 min     |

\*Gmail has daily sending limits (~500/day)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Emails not sending?

- Check console for error messages
- Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD are correct
- For Gmail: Make sure you're using App Password, not regular password

### Emails going to spam?

- Use a professional email service (SendGrid/Mailgun)
- Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
- Ask users to whitelist your email

### Still seeing console logs?

- That's normal! It's a fallback feature
- If email is configured, it sends email AND logs to console
- If email is NOT configured, it only logs to console

---

## 🎓 Next Steps

### For Development:

- Keep using console logging (no setup needed)
- Or set up Gmail for testing real emails

### For Production:

1. Sign up for SendGrid or Mailgun
2. Configure SMTP settings in .env
3. Set up custom domain for emails
4. Configure DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
5. Test email delivery
6. Monitor sending logs
