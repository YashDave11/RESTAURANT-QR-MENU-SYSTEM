# 🔐 Explicit Login System - Complete Fix

## Problem Identified

When logged in as restaurant owner and scanning QR code to order food, the system was NOT asking for customer login. It was automatically using the restaurant session.

## Solution Implemented

**Explicit customer login required** for all ordering operations, regardless of other active sessions.

---

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. **Customer Login Modal**

Created `src/components/CustomerLoginModal.jsx`:

- Shows when customer tries to checkout without customer login
- Supports both login and registration
- Option to continue as guest
- Beautiful, user-friendly UI

### 2. **Menu Page Protection**

Updated `src/pages/customer/MenuPage.jsx`:

- Checks `isCustomerAuthenticated` before checkout
- Shows login modal if not logged in as customer
- Allows browsing menu without login
- Requires login only at checkout

### 3. **Checkout Page Protection**

Updated `src/pages/customer/CheckoutPage.jsx`:

- Checks customer authentication on page load
- Shows login modal if not authenticated
- Redirects back to menu if login cancelled

### 4. **No Automatic Session Switching**

- Removed automatic session switching
- Each session type requires explicit login
- Restaurant login ≠ Customer login
- Admin login ≠ Customer login

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Scenario: Restaurant Owner Orders Food

```
1. Restaurant Owner logged into dashboard
   ✓ Restaurant session active
   ✓ Can manage restaurant

2. Scans QR code at another restaurant
   ✓ Opens menu page
   ✓ Can browse menu (no login needed)
   ✓ Can add items to cart (no login needed)

3. Clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
   ✗ NOT logged in as customer
   → Shows Customer Login Modal
   → Must login/register as customer
   → Or continue as guest

4. After customer login
   ✓ Customer session created (separate from restaurant)
   ✓ Can complete order
   ✓ Restaurant session still active in other tab

5. Goes back to restaurant dashboard
   ✓ Still logged in as restaurant
   ✓ Can see the order placed
```

## 🔒 Session Isolation

### Separate Sessions

```
Customer Session
├─ Token: customer_token
├─ Used for: Ordering food
└─ Required for: Checkout, Order tracking

Restaurant Session
├─ Token: restaurant_token
├─ Used for: Managing restaurant
└─ Required for: Dashboard, Menu management

Admin Session
├─ Token: admin_token
├─ Used for: Platform management
└─ Required for: Admin panel
```

### No Cross-Session Access

```
✗ Restaurant token ≠ Customer access
✗ Customer token ≠ Restaurant access
✗ Admin token ≠ Customer/Restaurant access

Each requires explicit login!
```

## 🔄 Additional Protections Needed

### Other Pages to Protect

1. **Order Status Page** (`/order/:orderId`)

   - Should check customer authentication
   - Or allow guest access with order ID

2. **Customer Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)

   - Requires customer login
   - Shows order history

3. **Cart Page** (`/cart`)
   - Can view without login
   - Requires login to checkout

### Implementation Pattern

```javascript
// In any customer page
import { useAuth } from "../context/MultiAuthContext";
import CustomerLoginModal from "../components/CustomerLoginModal";

function CustomerPage() {
  const { isCustomerAuthenticated } = useAuth();
  const [showLogin, setShowLogin] = useState(false);

  const handleProtectedAction = () => {
    if (!isCustomerAuthenticated) {
      setShowLogin(true);
      return;
    }
    // Proceed with action
  };

  return (
    <>
      {/* Page content */}

      {showLogin && (
        <CustomerLoginModal
          onClose={() => setShowLogin(false)}
          onSuccess={() => {
            setShowLogin(false);
            // Continue with action
          }}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

## 📊 Session State

### Before (Wrong)

```javascript
// Single session - conflicts!
{
  token: "restaurant_token",
  user: { restaurantName: "..." }
}

// Trying to order food
→ Uses restaurant token
→ Wrong! Restaurant can't place customer orders
```

### After (Correct)

```javascript
// Multiple independent sessions
{
  customer: {
    token: "customer_token",
    user: { name: "John" },
    isAuthenticated: true
  },
  restaurant: {
    token: "restaurant_token",
    user: { restaurantName: "..." },
    isAuthenticated: true
  }
}

// Ordering food
→ Checks customer.isAuthenticated
→ If false, shows login modal
→ Correct!
```
