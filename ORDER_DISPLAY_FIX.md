# ✅ Order Display Issue - FIXED!

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The restaurant orders page was using the wrong token key:

- ❌ Using: `localStorage.getItem("token")` (old/generic key)
- ✅ Should use: `localStorage.getItem("restaurant_token")` (session-specific key)

This caused authentication failures when fetching orders.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### File: `src/pages/restaurant/RestaurantOrdersPage.jsx`

**Before:**

```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
```

**After:**

```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem("restaurant_token");
```

### Added Debug Logging:

- Console logs to track order fetching
- Error response logging
- Token verification logging

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Frontend

```bash
# If using Vite dev server
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Login as Restaurant

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/restaurant/login
2. Login with your restaurant credentials

### Step 3: Check Orders Page

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/restaurant/orders
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for these logs:
   ```
   [Orders] Set restaurant token for API calls
   [Orders] Fetching orders...
   [Orders] Received orders: [...]
   ```

### Step 4: Create Test Order

1. Open menu as customer: http://localhost:3000/m/YOUR_RESTAURANT_ID
2. Add items to cart
3. Place order
4. Check restaurant orders page - order should appear!

## 🔍 Debug Checklist

### If orders still don't show:

1. **Check Browser Console**

   - Look for `[Orders]` logs
   - Check for error messages

2. **Verify Token Exists**

   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.getItem("restaurant_token");
   // Should return a long JWT string
   ```

3. **Check Backend Console**

   - Look for order creation logs
   - Check for authentication errors

4. **Verify Restaurant ID**
   - Make sure orders are being created for YOUR restaurant
   - Check `restaurantId` in order data

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### New Orders Column:

- Shows orders with status "placed"
- Blue "NEW" badge
- "Accept Order" button
- Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds

### Preparing Column:

- Shows orders with status "preparing"
- Displays estimated ready time
- "Mark as Ready" button

### Ready Column:

- Shows orders with status "ready"
- "Delivered" button

---

## 📊 Order Flow

1. **Customer places order** → Status: "placed"
2. **Restaurant accepts** → Status: "preparing" (sets wait time)
3. **Restaurant marks ready** → Status: "ready"
4. **Restaurant delivers** → Status: "delivered"

---

## 🔐 Session Management

The app now uses separate token keys for different user types:

- `customer_token` - For customer sessions
- `restaurant_token` - For restaurant sessions
- `admin_token` - For admin sessions

This allows multiple sessions to coexist without conflicts.

---

## ✅ Verification

After the fix, you should see:

- ✅ Orders appear in the orders page
- ✅ New orders show in "New Orders" column
- ✅ Can accept and update order status
- ✅ Auto-refresh works (every 10 seconds)
- ✅ No authentication errors in console

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

If you still have issues:

1. **Clear all localStorage**:

   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.clear();
   ```

2. **Logout and login again** as restaurant

3. **Check backend logs** for any errors

4. **Verify orders exist** in database:
   - Check MongoDB for orders collection
   - Verify restaurantId matches your restaurant
