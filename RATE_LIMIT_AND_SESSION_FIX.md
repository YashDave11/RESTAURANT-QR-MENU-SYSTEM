# ✅ Rate Limit & Session Persistence Fixed!

## 🔧 Issues Fixed:

### 1. ❌ "Too many requests" Error

**Problem**: Rate limits were too strict for development
**Solution**: Increased rate limits significantly

### 2. ❌ Auto-logout on Refresh

**Problem**: Session not persisting after page refresh
**Solution**: Fixed axios header initialization and session detection

---

## 📊 New Rate Limits (Development-Friendly)

### Before → After:

| Endpoint     | Before | After    | Window |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| General API  | 100    | **1000** | 15 min |
| Login        | 10     | **100**  | 15 min |
| Registration | 10     | **50**   | 15 min |
| Orders       | 10     | **100**  | 5 min  |

## 🔐 Session Persistence Fixes

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Axios Header Not Set on Refresh**

   - Now automatically detects active session
   - Sets authorization header on page load
   - Maintains session across refreshes

2. **Session Type Detection**

   - Auto-detects which session is active
   - Properly restores customer/restaurant/admin sessions
   - Sets currentSessionType automatically

3. **Token Validation**
   - Checks token age on initialization
   - Clears expired tokens (>7 days)
   - Refreshes tokens automatically

## 🧪 Test the Fixes

### Test 1: Rate Limit Fixed

1. Try logging in multiple times
2. Try creating multiple orders
3. No more "Too many requests" error! ✅

### Test 2: Session Persistence

1. Login as customer or restaurant
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. You should stay logged in! ✅
4. Navigate to different pages
5. Session persists! ✅

## 🚀 How to Apply

### Step 1: Restart Backend

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache (Optional)

- Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
- Clear "Cached images and files"
- Or just do a hard refresh: Ctrl+F5

### Step 3: Test!

1. Login: http://localhost:3000/login

## 📝 Files Modified

### Backend:

- `server/middleware/rateLimiter.js` - Increased all rate limits

### Frontend:

- `src/context/MultiAuthContext.jsx` - Fixed session persistence

## 🔍 Debug Info

If you still have issues, check browser console for these logs:

```
[MultiAuth] Sessions state: {...}
[MultiAuth] Set axios header for customer
[MultiAuth] isRestaurantAuthenticated: true
```

These logs show the session is working correctly.

## 💡 For Production

When deploying to production, you may want to:

1. **Reduce rate limits** back to stricter values:

   ```javascript
   max: 100; // for general API
   max: 10; // for auth endpoints
   ```

2. **Enable rate limit monitoring**:

   - Track rate limit hits
   - Alert on suspicious activity
   - Implement IP whitelisting for trusted sources

3. **Session security**:
   - Use secure cookies in production
   - Enable HTTPS
   - Implement CSRF protection

---

## ✅ Summary

Both issues are now fixed:

- ✅ No more "Too many requests" errors
- ✅ Sessions persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Orders work without auto-logout
- ✅ Multi-session support maintained

**Just restart your backend and test!** 🚀
