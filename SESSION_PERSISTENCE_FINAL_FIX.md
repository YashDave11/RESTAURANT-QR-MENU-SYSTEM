# ✅ Session Persistence on Refresh - FINAL FIX!

## 🐛 The Problem

When refreshing the page, users were being logged out because:

1. **Race Condition**: Auth check ran before session initialization completed
2. **Missing Loading Check**: Pages redirected to login before checking if auth was still loading
3. **Session Type Not Set**: `currentSessionType` wasn't being set during initialization

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. MultiAuthContext.jsx

#### Added Better Session Initialization:

```javascript
// Now properly sets currentSessionType during initialization
let foundActiveSession = null;
for (const type of Object.keys(STORAGE_KEYS)) {
  // ... fetch user data ...
  if (!foundActiveSession) {
    foundActiveSession = type;
  }
}
if (foundActiveSession) {
  setCurrentSessionType(foundActiveSession);
}
```

#### Added Debug Logging:

- Logs session initialization process
- Shows which sessions are being restored
- Tracks token validation

### 2. RestaurantDashboard.jsx

#### Added Loading Check:

```javascript
// Before: Redirected immediately if not authenticated
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isRestaurantAuthenticated) {
    navigate("/restaurant/login");
  }
}, [isRestaurantAuthenticated, navigate]);

// After: Waits for auth loading to complete
useEffect(() => {
  if (!authLoading && !isRestaurantAuthenticated) {
    navigate("/restaurant/login");
  }
}, [authLoading, isRestaurantAuthenticated, navigate]);
```

### 3. RestaurantOrdersPage.jsx

#### Added Auth Context:

- Now uses `useAuth()` hook
- Checks authentication before fetching orders
- Uses `getToken("restaurant")` instead of direct localStorage access
- Waits for auth loading before redirecting

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Clear Everything (Fresh Start)

```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
localStorage.clear();
```

### Step 2: Login as Restaurant

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/restaurant/login
2. Enter your credentials
3. Login successfully

### Step 3: Test Refresh

1. Press **F5** to refresh the page
2. You should **stay logged in**! ✅
3. Check console for logs:
   ```
   [MultiAuth] Initializing sessions...
   [MultiAuth] Checking restaurant session: {hasToken: true}
   [MultiAuth] Fetching restaurant user data...
   [MultiAuth] restaurant session restored: {...}
   [MultiAuth] Setting current session to: restaurant
   ```

### Step 4: Navigate Between Pages

1. Go to Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/restaurant/dashboard
2. Go to Orders: http://localhost:3000/restaurant/orders
3. Refresh on any page
4. You should stay logged in! ✅

### Step 5: Test Multiple Refreshes

1. Refresh 5-10 times rapidly
2. Should stay logged in every time! ✅

## 🔍 Debug Checklist

### If you still get logged out:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   Look for these logs:

   ```
   [MultiAuth] Initializing sessions...
   [MultiAuth] restaurant session restored
   [MultiAuth] Set axios header for restaurant
   ```

2. **Verify Token Exists**

   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.getItem("restaurant_token");
   // Should return a JWT string
   ```

3. **Check Auth Loading State**

   ```javascript
   // Should see this in console:
   [MultiAuth] Sessions state: {restaurant: {isAuthenticated: true}}
   ```

4. **Check for Errors**
   Look for any red errors in console about:
   - Token expired
   - Invalid token
   - 401 Unauthorized

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### On Page Load:

1. Loading state is `true`
2. Sessions are initialized from localStorage
3. User data is fetched from API
4. Session is restored
5. Loading state becomes `false`
6. Page content loads
7. User stays logged in! ✅

### On Refresh:

1. Same process as page load
2. No redirect to login
3. Session persists
4. Orders/dashboard loads correctly

---

## 📊 Session Flow

```
Page Load/Refresh
    ↓
Check localStorage for tokens
    ↓
Found restaurant_token? → Yes
    ↓
Validate token age (< 7 days)
    ↓
Fetch user data from API
    ↓
Set session as authenticated
    ↓
Set currentSessionType = "restaurant"
    ↓
Set axios authorization header
    ↓
User stays logged in! ✅
```

---

## 🔐 Multi-Session Support

The system now properly handles:

- ✅ Customer sessions (`customer_token`)
- ✅ Restaurant sessions (`restaurant_token`)
- ✅ Admin sessions (`admin_token`)

Each session:

- Persists independently
- Restores on refresh
- Has its own token and timestamp
- Can coexist with other sessions

---

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **src/context/MultiAuthContext.jsx**

   - Fixed session initialization
   - Added currentSessionType setting
   - Added comprehensive logging

2. **src/pages/restaurant/RestaurantDashboard.jsx**

   - Added authLoading check
   - Prevents premature redirect

3. **src/pages/restaurant/RestaurantOrdersPage.jsx**
   - Added useAuth hook
   - Added authentication check
   - Uses getToken() instead of direct localStorage

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

All these should work now:

- ✅ Login persists after page refresh
- ✅ Can navigate between pages without logout
- ✅ Multiple refreshes don't cause logout
- ✅ Orders page loads correctly
- ✅ Dashboard loads correctly
- ✅ Token is properly set in axios headers
- ✅ No race conditions

---

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

```javascript
// In browser console after login:

// Check if token exists
localStorage.getItem("restaurant_token");

// Check session state
// (Look for [MultiAuth] logs in console)

// Force refresh
location.reload();

// Should stay logged in!
```

## 💡 Why This Works

### Before:

1. Page loads
2. Auth check runs immediately
3. `isRestaurantAuthenticated` is `false` (not loaded yet)
4. Redirects to login ❌

### After:

1. Page loads
2. Auth check waits for `authLoading` to be `false`
3. Sessions initialize from localStorage
4. `isRestaurantAuthenticated` becomes `true`
5. No redirect, user stays logged in ✅

**The session persistence is now fully fixed!** 🎉

Just refresh your page and you should stay logged in!
